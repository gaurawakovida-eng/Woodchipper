# Woodchipper Mechanism Design & Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
* **Objective:** Designed a heavy-duty woodchipper mechanism capable of breaking down solid organic materials using a high-force rotating cutting system.
* **Context:** Collaborative academic project for the BSc in Engineering program at Széchenyi István University.

## ⚙️ My Specific Contributions
While this project was developed as a team, I served as the **Main Designer**. My specific responsibilities included:
* **3D CAD Modeling:** Led the primary structural and mechanical design using [Insert CAD Software Name].
* **Mechanical Calculations:** Executed the required force and structural calculations strictly according to the provided project instructions to ensure design safety.
* **Component Integration:** Assembled the complete digital model, ensuring all parts fit within required mechanical tolerances.

## ⚠️ Design Disclaimer
* To optimize the design process and reflect real-world engineering practices, certain standard components (e.g., fasteners, flange bearing unit, motor, belt tensioner etc.) used in this digital assembly were sourced from freely available online CAD catalogs.
